(2005). We are given\n","a training set {z1,...,z l}of examples, where each zi ∈Z is a pair ( xi,yi); xi ∈Rd is the\n","vector of attributes for example iand yi ∈R is the label of that example. We are also given\n","a new unlabeled example xl+1 and our task is to state something about our conﬁdence in\n","diﬀerent values ˜y for the label yl+1 of this example.

Formally, a nonconformity\n","measure is a family of functions An : Z(n−1) ×Z →R, n= 1,2,... (where Z(n−1) is the set\n","of all multisets of size n−1), which assign a numerical score\n","αi = An({z1,...,z i−1,zi+1,...,z n},zi) (1)\n","to each example zi, indicating how diﬀerent it is from the examples in the multiset\n","{z1,...,z i−1,zi+1,...,z n}.\n","As mentioned in Section 1 each nonconformity measure is based on some traditional\n","machine learning method, which is called the underlying algorithm of the corresponding\n","CP. Given a training set of examples {z1,...,z l+1}, each such method creates a prediction\n","rule\n","D{z1,...,zl+1},\n","which maps any unlabeled example x to a label ˆy. As this prediction rule is based on the\n","examples in the training set, the nonconformity score of an example zi ∈{z1,...,z l+1}is\n","measured as the disagreement between the predicted label\n","ˆyi = D{z1,...,zl+1}(xi) (2)\n","and the actual label yi of zi. Alternatively, we can create the prediction rule\n","D{z1,...,zi−1,zi+1,...,zl+1}\n","using all the examples in the set except zi, and measure the disagreement between\n","ˆyi = D{z1,...,zi−1,zi+1,...,zl+1}(xi) (3)\n","and yi.\n","818\n"]}]}]}
